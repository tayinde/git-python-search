# git-python-search
## Overview
This program searches for users on Github using Github's API. There is nothing overly spectacular about this program, it was simply created to practice Python, as I have recently started learning it.

## Run Program
You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed to your system, and then you can simply run `python gitsearch example-username` in the parent directory of the project<br>
From here you can choose the number behind the username that you want to see information about.
### Unix
For all Unix users, you may have noticed the shebang at the top of the [gitsearch](/gitsearch) file, this means you can execute it by giving the program execution permission with `chmod +x ./search` and then simply running the program with `./search example-username`
