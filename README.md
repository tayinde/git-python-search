# git-python-search
## Overview
This program searches for users on Github using Github's API. There is nothing overly spectacular about this program, it was simply created to practice Python, as I have recently started learning it.

## Run Program
You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed to your system, and then you can simply run `python search <username you want to search>` in the parent directory of the project<br>
A simple example would be `python search user12300`<br>
From here you can choose the number behind the username that you want to see information about.
